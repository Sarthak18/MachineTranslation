The research involves using the concept of deep learning to retrieve cross-lingual information.
Word2Vec is used to create vector spaces and the information from these embeddings will be used for bilingual translation.
A translation function or matrix will be created to match the relative positions across two monolingual vector spaces.
Testing will be done on ground truth.
