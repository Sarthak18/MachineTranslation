Machine Translation is a task in Natural language processing (NLP), where the automatic systems are used to translate the text from one language to another language. In this work we implement Word2Vec algorithm to create Machine Translation system where the automatic translation is used to translate from English to Spanish. Word2Vec algorithm is widely used in Auto Machine Translation recently. It is also used in several NLP models such as text classification, text filtering by tags, and word and phrase translation. In this paper, we will introduce the main structure of Machine Translation and Word2Vec, mathematical model with some formulas, and will study the process of Machine Translation from English to Spanish.

The research involves using the concept of deep learning to retrieve cross-lingual information.
Word2Vec is used to create vector spaces and the information from these embeddings will be used for bilingual translation.
A translation function or matrix will be created to match the relative positions across two monolingual vector spaces.
Testing will be done on ground truth.
